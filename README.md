readme.md description-=my first github repo
this is the readme file for my first github project. sadly, this is a public project, thats what you get for free; in order to have a private github project, i need to pay at least $84/yr. i'll have to be very confident that somehow this github could be worth that, aka, i'd have to be certain that my projects could make this amount PLUS the amount of maintaining the other components of this creation... before i'm willing to COMMIT (LOL) those resources($).
